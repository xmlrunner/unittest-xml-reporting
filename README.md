# unittest-xml-reporting (aka xmlrunner)

A unittest test runner that can save test results to XML files in xUnit format.
The files can be consumed by a wide range of tools, such as build systems, IDEs
and continuous integration servers.

* Please note Python 3.6 end-of-life was in Dec 2021, last version supporting 3.6 was 3.1.0
* Please note Python 3.5 end-of-life was in Sep 2020, last version supporting 3.5 was 3.1.0
* Please note Python 2.7 end-of-life was in Jan 2020, last version supporting 2.7 was 2.5.2
* Please note Python 3.4 end-of-life was in Mar 2019, last version supporting 3.4 was 2.5.2
* Please note Python 2.6 end-of-life was in Oct 2013, last version supporting 2.6 was 1.14.0


## Limited support for `unittest.TestCase.subTest`

https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.subTest

`unittest` has the concept of sub-tests for a `unittest.TestCase`; this doesn't map well to an existing xUnit concept, so you won't find it in the schema. What that means, is that you lose some granularity
in the reports for sub-tests.

`unittest` also does not report successful sub-tests, so the accounting won't be exact.

## Jenkins plugins

- Jenkins JUnit plugin : https://plugins.jenkins.io/junit/
- Jenkins xUnit plugin : https://plugins.jenkins.io/xunit/

### Jenkins JUnit plugin

This plugin does not perform XSD validation (at time of writing) and should parse the XML file without issues.

### Jenkins xUnit plugin version 1.100

- [Jenkins (junit-10.xsd), xunit plugin (2014-2018)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/xunit-plugin/blob/14c6e39c38408b9ed6280361484a13c6f5becca7/src/main/resources/org/jenkinsci/plugins/xunit/types/model/xsd/junit-10.xsd), version `1.100`.

This plugin does perfom XSD validation and uses the more lax XSD. This should parse the XML file without issues.

### Jenkins xUnit plugin version 1.104+

- [Jenkins (junit-10.xsd), xunit plugin (2018-current)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/xunit-plugin/blob/ae25da5089d4f94ac6c4669bf736e4d416cc4665/src/main/resources/org/jenkinsci/plugins/xunit/types/model/xsd/junit-10.xsd), version `1.104`+.

This plugin does perfom XSD validation and uses the more strict XSD.

See https://github.com/xmlrunner/unittest-xml-reporting/issues/209

```
import io
import unittest
import xmlrunner

# run the tests storing results in memory
out = io.BytesIO()
unittest.main(
    testRunner=xmlrunner.XMLTestRunner(output=out),
    failfast=False, buffer=False, catchbreak=False, exit=False)
```

Transform the results removing extra attributes.
```
from xmlrunner.extra.xunit_plugin import transform

with open('TEST-report.xml', 'wb') as report:
    report.write(transform(out.getvalue()))

```

## JUnit Schema ?

There are many tools claiming to write JUnit reports, so you will find many schemas with minor differences.

We used the XSD that was available in the Jenkins xUnit plugin version `1.100`; a copy is available under `tests/vendor/jenkins/xunit-plugin/.../junit-10.xsd` (see attached license).

## Installation

The easiest way to install unittest-xml-reporting is via
[Pip](http://www.pip-installer.org):

````bash
$ pip install unittest-xml-reporting
````

If you use Git and want to get the latest *development* version:

````bash
$ git clone https://github.com/xmlrunner/unittest-xml-reporting.git
$ cd unittest-xml-reporting
$ sudo python setup.py install
````

Or get the latest *development* version as a tarball:

````bash
$ wget https://github.com/xmlrunner/unittest-xml-reporting/archive/master.zip
$ unzip master.zip
$ cd unittest-xml-reporting
$ sudo python setup.py install
````

Or you can manually download the latest released version from
[PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/unittest-xml-reporting/).


## Command-line

````bash
python -m xmlrunner [options]
python -m xmlrunner discover [options]

# help
python -m xmlrunner -h
````

e.g. 
````bash
python -m xmlrunner discover -t ~/mycode/tests -o /tmp/build/junit-reports
````

## Usage

The script below, adapted from the
[unittest](http://docs.python.org/library/unittest.html), shows how to use
`XMLTestRunner` in a very simple way. In fact, the only difference between
this script and the original one is the last line:

````python
import random
import unittest
import xmlrunner

class TestSequenceFunctions(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        self.seq = list(range(10))

    @unittest.skip("demonstrating skipping")
    def test_skipped(self):
        self.fail("shouldn't happen")

    def test_shuffle(self):
        # make sure the shuffled sequence does not lose any elements
        random.shuffle(self.seq)
        self.seq.sort()
        self.assertEqual(self.seq, list(range(10)))

        # should raise an exception for an immutable sequence
        self.assertRaises(TypeError, random.shuffle, (1,2,3))

    def test_choice(self):
        element = random.choice(self.seq)
        self.assertTrue(element in self.seq)

    def test_sample(self):
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            random.sample(self.seq, 20)
        for element in random.sample(self.seq, 5):
            self.assertTrue(element in self.seq)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main(
        testRunner=xmlrunner.XMLTestRunner(output='test-reports'),
        # these make sure that some options that are not applicable
        # remain hidden from the help menu.
        failfast=False, buffer=False, catchbreak=False)
````

### Reporting to a single file

````python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    with open('/path/to/results.xml', 'wb') as output:
        unittest.main(
            testRunner=xmlrunner.XMLTestRunner(output=output),
            failfast=False, buffer=False, catchbreak=False)
````

### Doctest support

The XMLTestRunner can also be used to report on docstrings style tests.

````python
import doctest
import xmlrunner

def twice(n):
    """
    >>> twice(5)
    10
    """
    return 2 * n

class Multiplicator(object):
    def threetimes(self, n):
        """
        >>> Multiplicator().threetimes(5)
        15
        """
        return 3 * n

if __name__ == "__main__":
    suite = doctest.DocTestSuite()
    xmlrunner.XMLTestRunner().run(suite)
````

### Django support

In order to plug `XMLTestRunner` to a Django project, add the following
to your `settings.py`:

````python
TEST_RUNNER = 'xmlrunner.extra.djangotestrunner.XMLTestRunner'
````

Also, the following settings are provided so you can fine tune the reports:

|setting|default|values|description|
|-|-|-|-|
|`TEST_OUTPUT_VERBOSE`|`1`|`0\|1\|2`|Besides the XML reports generated by the test runner, a bunch of useful information is printed to the `sys.stderr` stream, just like the `TextTestRunner` does. Use this setting to choose between a verbose and a non-verbose output.|
|`TEST_OUTPUT_DESCRIPTIONS`|`False`|`True\|False`|If your test methods contains docstrings, you can display such docstrings instead of display the test name (ex: `module.TestCase.test_method`).<br>In order to use this feature, you have to enable verbose output by setting `TEST_OUTPUT_VERBOSE = 2`.<br>Only effects stdout and not XML output.|
|`TEST_OUTPUT_DIR`|`"."`|`<str>`|Tells the test runner where to put the XML reports. If the directory couldn't be found, the test runner will try to create it before generate the XML files.|
|`TEST_OUTPUT_FILE_NAME`|`None`|`<str>`|Tells the test runner to output a single XML report with this filename under `os.path.join(TEST_OUTPUT_DIR, TEST_OUTPUT_FILE_NAME)`.<br>Please note that for long running tests, this will keep the results in memory for a longer time than multiple reports, and may use up more resources.|
